## Coursera_Capstone
### This notebook will be used as part of my Coursera Applied Data Science Capstone Project.
### This notebook is a culmination of the last 6 months of my free time:
1. Python Crash Course
2. Idiot's Guide to Data Science
3. Countless hours banging my head trying to get Pycharm, JupyterLab, and Anaconda to work without Admin rights to my Lenovo.
3. IBM Data Science Professional Certificate
